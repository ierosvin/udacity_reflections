i need to initialize repo so we can start tracking changes

staging offers a pre-commit status for your repo

use staging area to select which files are part of one logical change

branches is helpful in cases where in you want to test a new feature

log diagrams is very helpful!

merging two branches together is easy to read because of graph

auto merge makes the merging a lot faster
